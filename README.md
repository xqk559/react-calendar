# Every Day Calendar

Every Day Calendar inspired by Simone Giertz's project: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simonegiertz/the-every-day-calendar

It stores clicked days in `localStorage`.

It looks like this:

You can use it as a mobile app by visiting
https://kissgyorgy.me/every-day-calendar/ and using the "Add to Home Screen" button.

You can add it multiple times with different names and they will have different
`localStorage` objects, so you can use it to track different things:
